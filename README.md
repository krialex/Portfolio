This is my portfolio!

## Description

Here, I showcase my projects so far. These are assignments given to me by my school, interpreted in my own way. I started completely unaware of development and coding, but throughout the educational program, I have learned a lot. I still have a long way to go, and if there's one thing I've realized in this world of websites and apps, it's that one is never done learning.
